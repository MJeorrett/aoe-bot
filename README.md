# Age of Empires II Build Order Tool
This is a simple client only app to test build orders out quickly.  It is definitely more useful as a coding excercise than to actually help with figuring out Age of Empires stratgies!

## Pre-requisites
In order to run this you need the following:
- node
- yarn

## Running
To run the app on _localhost:3000_:
- run `yarn install` in root directory.
- run `yarn start`

## Features
- Click one of the "Add action" dropdowns and select an action to add it.
- If you add a "Continuous" action, such as "Forage" or "Idle", then you can change the duration of the action.
- Click on the timeline at the top to see the current resources at any point in time based on the actions that you have taken.
